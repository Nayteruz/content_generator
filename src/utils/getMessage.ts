Your task is to prepare a list of questions (no fewer than 5 and no more than 7) for writing content on the ${pageName} page of this website. 
          The questions should be formulated in a way that the site owner can provide answers, and these answers will help you in the next step to create the highest quality, unique, and relevant text for the page. It is recommended to include examples in the questions to make it easier for the user to understand what to write in their response.
